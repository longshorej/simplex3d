The library mimics GLSL so it is easy to use. Additional benefit of being close GLSL is that you can recycle your GLSL skills using a familiar set of constructs and functions. If you are new to GLSL then using simplex3d mathlib should make it easier for you to use GLSL in the future.

== Getting started ==

Download simplex3dMath.jar and add it to your classpath. In your scala file, use the following imports:
{{{
import simplex3d.math.floatm.renamed._ //using short names for Float data types
import simplex3d.math.floatm.FloatMath._ //using all float functions
}}}

Below is a short example on how to construct and use the model view matrix:
{{{
val translation = Vec3(1, 2, 3)
val rotation = quatFrom(radians(60), normalize(Vec3(1))
val scale = Vec3(1, 2, 1)

val model = Transform(translation, rotation, scale)
val view = InverseTransform(cam.translation, cam.rotation, cam.scale)
val modelView = view*model

val eyeCoords = modelView.transformPoint(p)
}}}

== Compiler plugin ==
Initially there was a plan to make a compiler plugin. However after evaluating new JVM switch -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis the compiler plugin was cancelled.<br/>
Escape analysis seems to eliminate temporary new objects in the critical sections of the code, giving results that are very close to the results with temporary variable management the compiler plugin was supposed to do.<br/>
JVM can optimise code at a lower level and managing temporary valiriables manually or via compiler plugin can interfere with that process causing the code to perform slower in some cases.<br/>
Additionally, JVM will continue to improve as it always does. So even if the compiler plugin is capable of giving marginally better results now, that will not always be the case.

== Feedback ==

Any feedback regarding code correctness and optimization is welcomed. However keep in mind that the aim of the library is to stay as close to GLSL as possible, things that are astray from this path are unlikely to be implemented.
