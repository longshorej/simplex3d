The library mimics GLSL so it is easy to use. Additional benefit of being similar to GLSL is that you can recycle your GLSL skills using a familiar set of constructs and functions. If you are new to GLSL then using simplex3d mathlib should make it easier for you to use GLSL in the future.

== Feedback ==

Any feedback regarding code correctness and optimization is welcomed. However keep in mind that the aim of the library is to stay as close to GLSL as possible, things that are astray from this path are unlikely to be implemented.
