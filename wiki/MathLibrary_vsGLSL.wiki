#summary Differences with GLSL

[MathLibrary Back to Index]

Aside from obvious differences, such as Scala variable declaration and function signatures, there are other minor differences.

== Type declarations ==

To stay consistent with Scala object naming conversions, the type names are distinct from GLSL.

Vectors examples:
|| *GLSL* || *Simplex3d* ||
|| vec2 || Vec2 ||
|| ivec2 || Vec2i ||
|| bvec2 || Vec2b ||

Matrix examples:
|| *GLSL* || *Simplex3d* ||
|| mat2 || Mat2 ||
|| mat2x2 || Mat2x2 ||
|| mat2x3 || Mat2x3 ||

If desired, you can change type declarations to be exactly the same as in GLSL using Scala imports. For example:
{{{
import simplex3d.math.{Vec3 => vec3, Vec3i => ivec3, Vec3b => bvec3}
}}}

== Swizzling ==
Only `xyzw` and `rgba` swilling modes are supported for integer and floating point vectors. Chain swizzling (eg: v.wyxz.yx) is supported for read operations but not supported for write operations (v.wyxz.yx = u will not compile).

== Constants ==

Instead of `const` modifier there is a corresponding immutable object for each type. The Const classes are final and their accessors are read-only, so you have a compile time guarantee that the values will stay unchanged. Examples:
{{{
//defining a constant using declared type
var v: ConstVec4 = Vec4(1) //implicit conversion from Vec4 to ConstVec4

//defining constant using a factory
val u = ConstVec3(1, 2, 3)
}}}

Using constants:
{{{
var mutable: Vec3 = Vec3(1)
var constant = ConstVec3(2, 2, 2)

//implicit conversion from const to mutable
mutable = constant
//copy without reassigning
mutable := constant

//implicit conversion from mutable to const
constant = mutable

val finalConstant = ConstVec3(1, 1, 1)
finalConstant = mutable //compile time error, since val cannot be reassigned
}}}

When writing functions, you can support both constant and mutable types without implicit conversions. To accomplish this, use the common supertype AnyVec:
{{{
//This function will trigger an implicit conversion if v is ConstVec3.
def foo(v: Vec3) = 2*v

//This function will accept both ConstVec3 and Vec3 without implicit conversions
def foo(v: AnyVec3) = 2*v

//Similar for matrices:
def bar(m: AnyMat3) :Mat3 = m*Mat3(2)
}}}

== Matrix as multidimensional array ==

Writing into matrix using array notation is different from GLSL. Example:
{{{
val m = Mat3(1)
m(0)(0) = 2 //compile time error
m(0, 0) = 2 //works
}}}

== Matrix constructors ==

Unlike GLSL, matrix constructors do not accept an arbitrary mix of floats and vectors. You can specify all the values or all the columns to construct a matrix.
Example:
{{{
val s = Mat4(2) // a 4x4 matrix with 2 on diagonal
val m = Mat2(1, 2, 3, 4)
val n = Mat3(Vec3.UnitX, Vec3.UnitY, Vec3.UnitZ)
}}}

== Casting Vectors ==

Casting vectors is similar to casting primitives, if a primitive can be automatically converted, so can the vector. For example:
{{{
val v = Vec3f(1)
val u = Vec3i(2)
v = u // integer vector u is promoted to the float vector
}}}

In cases when the primitive type cannot be promoted, you have to do a manual cast:
{{{
val v = Vec3f(1)
val u = Vec3d(2)
v = u // compile time error, since double cannot be promoted to float
v = Vec3f(u) // works
}}}

== Casting Matrices ==

To cast float matrices to doubles or vice versa, use vector or primitive accessors as arguments in the corresponding constructor:
{{{
// using primitive accessors
val a = Mat2f(1)
val b = Mat2d(a.m00, a.m01, a.m10, a.m11)

// using vector accessors
val m = Mat3d(1)
val n = Mat3f(m(0), m(1), m(2))
}}}

== Modf ==
`modf(x: float, i: *float)` is missing because of the lack of pointers in the language. The vector versions of modf are present.

= Additions not present in GLSL =

Below is a quick reference of functions included into the MathLibrary that are not present in GLSL.

== Casting ==

Scala native casting `asInstanceOf[Type]` looks somewhat odd in math code. To make the code more readable it is recommended to use these casts:
  * byte(x)
  * short(x)
  * int(x)
  * long(x)
  * float(x)
  * double(x)

Examples:
{{{
val a = float(java.lang.Math.PI) //this is just an example, the constant Pi is defined in FloatMath
val b = int(sin(Pi/2)*100)
}}}

== Other additions ==

  * `:=` operator, equivalent to set(), but does not require parentheses
  * `lengthSquare` method if you want to avoid using square root
  * `approxEqual` to compare floating point numbers, vectors and matrices
  * functions to generate random float, int and boolean vectors
  * Quaternions and angle/axis rotations
  * `lerp` for matrices and `slerp` for quaternions
  * Projection matrices for camera
  * 2x3 and 3x4 matrices as transformations
  * Flexible way to build transformations
  * Matrix inverse
