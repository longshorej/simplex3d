Download simplex3dMath.jar and add it to your classpath. In your scala file, use the following imports:
{{{
import simplex3d.math.floatm.renamed._ //using short names for Float data types
import simplex3d.math.floatm.FloatMath._ //using all float functions
}}}

Below is a short example on how to construct and use the model-view matrix:
{{{
val scale = Vec3(1)
scale.xy += 2

// Unlike multiplication, rotation operations are applied in order
// from left to right.
val rotation = Quat4 rotateX(radians(60)) rotateY(radians(45))
val translation = Vec3(1, 2, 3)

// Again, transformation operations are applied in order from left
// to right and can be chained indefinitely in any desired order.
val model = Mat3x4 scale(scale) rotate(rotation) translate(translation)

// There are also a shorthand methods that compute standard
// transformations more efficiently.
val view = inverseTransformation(cam.scale, rotationMat(cam.rotation), cam.translation)
val modelView = model.concatenate(view)

val eyeCoords = modelView.transformPoint(p)
}}}
