## Simplex3d Vector Math DSL ##

Simplex3d Math DSL resembles GLSL and has the same set of functions. If you are familiar with GLSL, then you are ready to use Simplex3d Math. Conversely, when you are learning the Math DSL, you are also learning GLSL.

**Features:**
  * **Consistent syntax.**
  * **Vector and matrix operators.**
  * **Swizzling.**
  * **A large set of standard functions.**
  * **Quaternions.**
  * **Easy to use 2d and 3d transformation matrices.**

_**This library is fully tested.**_

## Simplex3d Data Binding API ##

Simplex3d Data API is designed to simplify access to raw numerical data that defines geometry and textures.

**Features:**
  * **Seamless integration with Simplex3d Math DSL.**
  * **Simple and convinient API.**
  * **On-the-fly data conversion.**
  * **Support for arrays, direct buffers, and interleaved buffers.**
  * **Specialization for primitive types.**
  * **Integrated with scala.collection.**
  * **Compatible with any native API.**

_**This library is fully tested.**_
